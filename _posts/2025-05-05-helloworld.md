This is more of a test post than anything else, but welcome to my web log! Experience has taught me that computers are pain and that memory is fickle, I'm writing these posts with myself as the primary audience and I'm publishing them so that maybe they can help somebody else out.

Here's some things to know about me that (hopefully) will shine through in the blog posts to come:

0. I'm not a smart person, but I ain't no dumbass. I get by.
  - I make mistakes. A lot of them. Sometimes I choose to work inefficiently, sometimes I just don't know no better.
  - I like for things to just work until the thing is dead, and it's time to fashion a replacement. I'm not trying to work harder than I have to, I'm a bit of a luddite, if it works then it works.
  - I intend to spell everything out plainly in my writing. If it's an instructional, I'll put the exact tools I used, the steps I took, the commands I entered to arrive at the end state. If I don't, get at me, I'll do my best to update the content.
  - Rarely if ever, will I be posting about something novel and new. I'm an iterator and collaborator, I recognise good things and modify them to my own purposes.
1. I suffer from good intentions.
  - Sometimes my eyes are bigger than my stomach. I'll try my best to only write about things that are done, never teasing work to come. A lot of blogs on the internet read like sprints, highly active for a few years and then the author's attention moves on to other things. I'm only human and I'm planning to be one...
2. Your thoughts and inputs are welcomed.
  - I'm never (lol, "never say never") going to add any kind of commenting feature here. But if you know or can find a way to contact me, I'd love to hear what you have to say about the post.
  - Thinking about it a little, that's probably best facilitated through issues, pull requests?, or any contact info that may, or may not be associated to my profile.
